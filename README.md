Dataset:

Consumer Services Mediated Complaints
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Consumer-Services-Mediated-Complaints/nre2-6m2s/data


The goal of our application is to create a website that outlines the consumersâ€™ complaint history of businesses located in the United States. The application will use the 'Consumer Services Mediated Complaints' dataset found on 'NYC Open Data.' The website will serve as a platform for users to submit complaints and for stores to mediate complaints by hiring mediators with different years of experience. Specifically, each complaint posted on the website must be made by exactly one user about exactly one store, and each complaint must be resolved by exactly one mediation. The mediation entity set contains information about the start and end dates, customer satisfaction, and restitution to the user who complained. Furthermore, since some conglomerates have multiple stores in the United States, stores will have attributes to differentiate their locations. Additionally, users can post comments about specific complaints, and users can follow different stores of their interest. By nature, each comment must be made by one user and posted about one complaint. The website will enable users to find the complaint history of the businesses they wish to learn more about from the database. Additionally, the website will have a user interface that has filters for different industries, complaint types, locations, and restitution amounts based on what specifically the users want to attain. Overall, each entity set has an id that uniquely identifies them.
